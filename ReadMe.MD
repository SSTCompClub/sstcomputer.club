Greetings members of SST Computer Club.

I am Jasper, one of the founders of CC. Fatih and I were talking about a website, but at one point the idea just randomly vanished, until one moment when it was brough back as an idea that Grant and Otakar where talking about. So, we decided to continue with the project and use the funding we've recieved from the LAN parties to pay for the existance of this website.

The intent of this website is for students to build this website and their knowladge. The main parts that this website will cover is News, File Management, and the history of CC itself.

Sincerely, the CC team.
